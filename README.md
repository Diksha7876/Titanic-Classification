# Bharat-Intern-Task--Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Algorithm which tells whether the person will be save from sinking or not
Purpose
Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

The dataset is available at Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulsah06/titanic
